# CoreUI

Shared, **focusable** UI primitives, the app theme, and the artwork image
cache that every feature module reuses. tvOS-only — guarded behind
`#if canImport(SwiftUI)` so the package still compiles on Linux for tests.

## Responsibility

- **Theme** — `Theme`, `ThemeOption` (System / Dark / OLED / Light) and
  the per-profile theme model, observed at the app root.
- **Focusable building blocks** — focus-aware buttons, cards, tab bars,
  parallax containers, brand QR code rendering, code-font numerals.
- **Async artwork** — `FallbackAsyncImage` and `ArtworkImageCache`: an
  on-disk + in-memory image cache shared with `MetadataKit`'s URL cache,
  with an `asyncFallbackURL` slot so server art is always tried first and
  the `MetadataKit` fallback only runs when needed.
- **Content state** — `ContentStateView` renders the `LoadState`
  loading / loaded / empty / failed states identically across features.
- **Caption customization UI** — the surfaces in `FeatureSettings` reuse
  `CaptionSettingsCard` from here so the live preview is identical.
- **Cast & metadata cards** — `CastRowView` and friends, used by Home /
  detail.

## Invariants

- **No Jellyfin/Plex specifics.** Components take `CoreModels` value
  types only.
- **No persistence other than caches.** Settings live in feature modules
  (`FeatureSettings`, `CoreModels.ProfileStore`).
- **Compiles without UI.** Files are guarded by `#if canImport(SwiftUI)`
  / `#if canImport(UIKit)` so the package still builds on Linux.

## Where to look first

- `ContentStateView.swift` — the unified load-state renderer.
- `ArtworkImageCache.swift` + `FallbackAsyncImage` — shared image cache &
  the server-first / fallback rendering pattern.
- `Theme.swift` — color/themes used everywhere.
